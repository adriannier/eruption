# Eruption
PHP script for turning FileMaker Pro XML into a directory and file structure.

## Motivation
As your FileMaker Pro solution grows you might find yourself losing overview. I did and I always wished I could use some of the tools most of the other development environments provide. So to have project-wide search, version control, and file comparison, I developed this script that turns an XML of your FileMaker Pro solution into a directory and file structure.

## Installation

1. Download or clone this repository

2. In your favorite terminal application, change to the project directory

3. Make the erupt file executable with ```chmod +x erupt```

## Running

The command line syntax for Eruption is:

```> erupt xml_file output_directory```

**erupt**

Path to the erupt executable found in the project directory

**xml_file**

Path to the XML file generated by FileMaker Pro 18 (or newer)

**output_directory**

Path to the directory where to store the eruption

Example:

```~/Downloads/Eruption/erupt ~/Desktop/filemaker.xml ~/Desktop```
